### Changelog

## ATTENTION! This is a migration update. Once you update to 2.0.0 a script will run to install and activate the new "Mai Theme Engine" plugin. After you update, please refresh the page in the admin to make sure "Mai Theme Engine" plugin is active and you can safely deactivate and delete "Mai Pro Engine". Sorry for the trouble, and this should never happen again. A name and plugin location change was necessary at this time.
